"""
Append-only audit event writer for the Audit & Governance bounded context.

``AuditWriter`` is the only mechanism through which bounded contexts emit
audit events. It writes ``AuditEvent`` records within the caller's existing
database session, ensuring that audit events are committed atomically with
the domain changes that triggered them.

Design contract:
- Audit events are written in the same transaction as the domain change.
  If the domain change rolls back, the audit event rolls back with it.
- ``record()`` never raises on constraint violations or duplicate IDs —
  the UUID PK guarantees uniqueness, and the caller controls the session.
- The ``sequence_number`` is assigned by the database on INSERT. The writer
  does not set it.
- ``actor_type`` defaults to "USER" when ``actor_id`` is provided; "SYSTEM"
  when it is None. Callers may override this for service account events.

Usage::

    writer = AuditWriter(session)
    writer.record(
        event_type="APPLICATION_CREATED",
        entity_type="APPLICATION",
        entity_id=application.id,
        tenant_id=application.tenant_id,
        application_id=application.id,
        actor_id=user.user_id,
        event_data={"status": "DRAFT"},
    )

Dependency rule: imports only from ``mil.kernel`` and ``mil.audit.models``.
No other bounded context may be imported here.

        Append a single audit event to the session.

        Args:
            event_type: One of the ``AuditEventType`` string constants from
                ``data-model.md`` (e.g. ``"APPLICATION_CREATED"``).
            entity_type: The domain entity category (e.g. ``"APPLICATION"``).
            entity_id: The UUID of the affected entity.
            tenant_id: The tenant context in which the event occurred.
            application_id: Associated application UUID for lifecycle
                correlation queries. May be None for cross-application events.
            actor_id: UUID of the authenticated user who triggered the event.
                None for system-driven events.
            actor_type: ``"USER"`` or ``"SYSTEM"``. Defaults to ``"USER"``
                when ``actor_id`` is provided, ``"SYSTEM"`` otherwise.
            event_data: Event-specific payload as a plain dict. Must be
                JSON-serialisable.

        Returns:
            The ``AuditEvent`` ORM instance, already added to the session.
