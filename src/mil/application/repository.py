"""
Repository for the Application & Party bounded context.

``ApplicationRepository`` is the only persistence mechanism for the
``MortgageApplication`` aggregate root. It loads and saves complete aggregate
instances — it never persists a ``Party`` in isolation because parties are
owned by the aggregate.

Responsibilities:
- Save (INSERT or UPDATE) a ``MortgageApplication`` and its parties.
- Load a ``MortgageApplication`` by ID, with parties eagerly loaded.
- After each save, drain the aggregate's pending domain events and write
  the corresponding audit records via ``AuditWriter``.
- Query applications by tenant for listing.

Audit events emitted (via ``AuditWriter`` in the same transaction):
- ``APPLICATION_CREATED`` — when a new application is first saved.
- ``PARTY_ADDED`` — when ``add_party()`` was called before this save.
- ``PARTY_REMOVED`` — when ``remove_party()`` was called before this save.
- ``APPLICATION_STATE_CHANGED`` — when a lifecycle transition was made.

The repository holds no opinion on whether to commit or rollback. The caller
(typically ``ApplicationService``) controls the session lifecycle.

Dependency rule: imports only from ``mil.kernel``, ``mil.application.models``,
and ``mil.audit``. No other bounded context may be imported.
