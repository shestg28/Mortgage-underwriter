Application and Party REST endpoints — MIL API v1.

Endpoints:
    POST   /v1/applications                              Create application
    GET    /v1/applications                              List applications for the tenant
    GET    /v1/applications/{application_id}             Get application
    POST   /v1/applications/{application_id}/submit      Submit application for review
    POST   /v1/applications/{application_id}/withdraw    Withdraw application
    POST   /v1/applications/{application_id}/parties     Add party
    DELETE /v1/applications/{application_id}/parties/{party_id}  Remove party
    GET    /v1/applications/{application_id}/parties     List parties

Route handlers are intentionally thin:
    - Validate the request body (Pydantic does this automatically).
    - Extract the authenticated user from the dependency.
    - Delegate to the service.
    - Map the service result to a response schema.
    - Return the response.

No business logic lives here.

Dependency rule: imports from ``mil.api.deps``, ``mil.api.v1.schemas``,
``mil.kernel.types``, FastAPI, and the Python standard library only.
