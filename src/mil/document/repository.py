"""
Repository for the Document Processing bounded context.

``DocumentRepository`` is the only persistence gateway for ``Document`` records.
All audit events emitted by the document aggregate are drained here and written
to the audit log via ``AuditWriter`` in the same database transaction.

ADR-005 note: Document's internal state events (DOCUMENT_UPLOADED,
DOCUMENT_STORED) use the same dict-based pending event pattern as
``MortgageApplication``. This is the intentional transitional design documented
in ADR-005. Migration to typed ``DomainEvent`` objects is deferred to US2.
The platform-level coordination event (``DocumentIngested``) is published on the
``EventBus`` by ``DocumentService`` using the typed ``DomainEvent`` hierarchy
from ``mil.kernel.events`` — that IS the full adoption path for external events.

Dependency rule: imports only from ``mil.document.models``, ``mil.kernel``,
and the Python standard library.

        Persist ``document`` and drain its pending events to the audit log.

        The drain happens in three steps:
          1. Collect pending events BEFORE flush (they reference pre-flush state).
          2. Add document to the session and flush.
          3. Write each event as an AuditEvent in the SAME session.

        ``actor`` is the authenticated user responsible for the change, or
        ``None`` for system-driven pipeline transitions (OCR worker, etc.). When
        ``None``, the audit event records a SYSTEM actor (``actor_id`` is null),
        per the ``AuditWriter`` contract.

        Atomicity: if ``session.flush()`` raises, pending events are not written.
        If ``audit.record()`` raises, the transaction rolls back with the domain flush.
